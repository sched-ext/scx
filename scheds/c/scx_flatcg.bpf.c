/*
 * A demo sched_ext flattened cgroup hierarchy scheduler. It implements
 * hierarchical weight-based cgroup CPU control by flattening the cgroup
 * hierarchy into a single layer by compounding the active weight share at each
 * level. Consider the following hierarchy with weights in parentheses:
 *
 * R + A (100) + B (100)
 *   |         \ C (100)
 *   \ D (200)
 *
 * Ignoring the root and threaded cgroups, only B, C and D can contain tasks.
 * Let's say all three have runnable tasks. The total share that each of these
 * three cgroups is entitled to can be calculated by compounding its share at
 * each level.
 *
 * For example, B is competing against C and in that competition its share is
 * 100/(100+100) == 1/2. At its parent level, A is competing against D and A's
 * share in that competition is 100/(200+100) == 1/3. B's eventual share in the
 * system can be calculated by multiplying the two shares, 1/2 * 1/3 == 1/6. C's
 * eventual shaer is the same at 1/6. D is only competing at the top level and
 * its share is 200/(100+200) == 2/3.
 *
 * So, instead of hierarchically scheduling level-by-level, we can consider it
 * as B, C and D competing each other with respective share of 1/6, 1/6 and 2/3
 * and keep updating the eventual shares as the cgroups' runnable states change.
 *
 * This flattening of hierarchy can bring a substantial performance gain when
 * the cgroup hierarchy is nested multiple levels. in a simple benchmark using
 * wrk[8] on apache serving a CGI script calculating sha1sum of a small file, it
 * outperforms CFS by ~3% with CPU controller disabled and by ~10% with two
 * apache instances competing with 2:1 weight ratio nested four level deep.
 *
 * However, the gain comes at the cost of not being able to properly handle
 * thundering herd of cgroups. For example, if many cgroups which are nested
 * behind a low priority parent cgroup wake up around the same time, they may be
 * able to consume more CPU cycles than they are entitled to. In many use cases,
 * this isn't a real concern especially given the performance gain. Also, there
 * are ways to mitigate the problem further by e.g. introducing an extra
 * scheduling layer on cgroup delegation boundaries.
 *
 * The scheduler first picks the cgroup to run and then schedule the tasks
 * within by using nested weighted vtime scheduling by default. The
 * cgroup-internal scheduling can be switched to FIFO with the -f option.
