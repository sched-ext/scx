/*
 * XXXETSAL This is convoluted for a reason. We have a three way conflict here:
 *
 * 1) intf.h gets parsed by bindgen, and I guess bindgen does not fully
 * preprocess the file because it does not resolve __arena to
 * __attribute__((address_space(1))) and errors out. So we cannot use the
 * __arena macro from bpf_arena_common.h that involves all this #ifdef'ing.
 * 2) Clang 18 full-on crashes if we pass address_space(1) as an attribute as it
 * is unable to generate the address space conversion instruction.
 * 3) Clang 19 requires the address_space attribute because address space
 * conversions can only be implicit.
 *
 * The below snippet replicates as tersely as possible the logic in
 * bpf_arena_common.h to get the code passing with both Clang 18 and 19.
