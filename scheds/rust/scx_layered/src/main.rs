/// scx_layered: A highly configurable multi-layer sched_ext scheduler
///
/// scx_layered allows classifying tasks into multiple layers and applying
/// different scheduling policies to them. The configuration is specified in
/// json and composed of two parts - matches and policies.
///
/// Matches
/// =======
///
/// Whenever a task is forked or its attributes are changed, the task goes
/// through a series of matches to determine the layer it belongs to. A
/// match set is composed of OR groups of AND blocks. An example:
///
///   "matches": [
///     [
///       {
///         "CgroupPrefix": "system.slice/"
///       }
///     ],
///     [
///       {
///         "CommPrefix": "fbagent"
///       },
///       {
///         "NiceAbove": 0
///       }
///     ]
///   ],
///
/// The outer array contains the OR groups and the inner AND blocks, so the
/// above matches:
///
/// - Tasks which are in the cgroup sub-hierarchy under "system.slice".
///
/// - Or tasks whose comm starts with "fbagent" and have a nice value > 0.
///
/// Currently, the following matches are supported:
///
/// - CgroupPrefix: Matches the prefix of the cgroup that the task belongs
///   to. As this is a string match, whether the pattern has the trailing
///   '/' makes a difference. For example, "TOP/CHILD/" only matches tasks
///   which are under that particular cgroup while "TOP/CHILD" also matches
///   tasks under "TOP/CHILD0/" or "TOP/CHILD1/".
///
/// - CommPrefix: Matches the task's comm prefix.
///
/// - PcommPrefix: Matches the task's thread group leader's comm prefix.
///
/// - NiceAbove: Matches if the task's nice value is greater than the
///   pattern.
///
/// - NiceBelow: Matches if the task's nice value is smaller than the
///   pattern.
///
/// - NiceEquals: Matches if the task's nice value is exactly equal to
///   the pattern.
///
/// - UIDEquals: Matches if the task's effective user id matches the value
///
/// - GIDEquals: Matches if the task's effective group id matches the value.
///
/// - PIDEquals: Matches if the task's pid matches the value.
///
/// - PPIDEquals: Matches if the task's ppid matches the value.
///
/// - TGIDEquals: Matches if the task's tgid matches the value.
///
/// - NSPIDEquals: Matches if the task's namespace id and pid matches the values.
///
/// - NSEquals: Matches if the task's namespace id matches the values.
///
/// - IsGroupLeader: Bool. When true, matches if the task is group leader
///   (i.e. PID == TGID), aka the thread from which other threads are made.
///   When false, matches if the task is *not* the group leader (i.e. the rest).
///
/// - CmdJoin: Matches when the task uses pthread_setname_np to send a join/leave
/// command to the scheduler. See examples/cmdjoin.c for more details.
///
/// - UsedGpuTid: Bool. When true, matches if the tasks which have used
///   gpus by tid.
///
/// - UsedGpuPid: Bool. When true, matches if the tasks which have used gpu
///   by tgid/pid.
///
/// While there are complexity limitations as the matches are performed in
/// BPF, it is straightforward to add more types of matches.
///
/// Policies
/// ========
///
/// The following is an example policy configuration for a layer.
///
///   "kind": {
///     "Confined": {
///       "cpus_range": [1, 8],
///       "util_range": [0.8, 0.9]
///     }
///   }
///
/// It's of "Confined" kind, which tries to concentrate the layer's tasks
/// into a limited number of CPUs. In the above case, the number of CPUs
/// assigned to the layer is scaled between 1 and 8 so that the per-cpu
/// utilization is kept between 80% and 90%. If the CPUs are loaded higher
/// than 90%, more CPUs are allocated to the layer. If the utilization drops
/// below 80%, the layer loses CPUs.
///
/// Currently, the following policy kinds are supported:
///
/// - Confined: Tasks are restricted to the allocated CPUs. The number of
///   CPUs allocated is modulated to keep the per-CPU utilization in
///   "util_range". The range can optionally be restricted with the
///   "cpus_range" property.
///
/// - Grouped: Similar to Confined but tasks may spill outside if there are
///   idle CPUs outside the allocated ones. The range can optionally be
///   restricted with the "cpus_range" property.
///
/// - Open: Prefer the CPUs which are not occupied by Confined or Grouped
///   layers. Tasks in this group will spill into occupied CPUs if there are
///   no unoccupied idle CPUs.
///
/// All layers take the following options:
///
/// - min_exec_us: Minimum execution time in microseconds. Whenever a task
///   is scheduled in, this is the minimum CPU time that it's charged no
///   matter how short the actual execution time may be.
///
/// - yield_ignore: Yield ignore ratio. If 0.0, yield(2) forfeits a whole
///   execution slice. 0.25 yields three quarters of an execution slice and
///   so on. If 1.0, yield is completely ignored.
///
/// - slice_us: Scheduling slice duration in microseconds.
///
/// - fifo: Use FIFO queues within the layer instead of the default vtime.
///
/// - preempt: If true, tasks in the layer will preempt tasks which belong
///   to other non-preempting layers when no idle CPUs are available.
///
/// - preempt_first: If true, tasks in the layer will try to preempt tasks
///   in their previous CPUs before trying to find idle CPUs.
///
/// - exclusive: If true, tasks in the layer will occupy the whole core. The
///   other logical CPUs sharing the same core will be kept idle. This isn't
///   a hard guarantee, so don't depend on it for security purposes.
///
/// - allow_node_aligned: Put node aligned tasks on layer DSQs instead of lo
///   fallback. This is a hack to support node-affine tasks without making
///   the whole scheduler node aware and should only be used with open
///   layers on non-saturated machines to avoid possible stalls.
///
/// - prev_over_idle_core: On SMT enabled systems, prefer using the same CPU
///   when picking a CPU for tasks on this layer, even if that CPUs SMT
///   sibling is processing a task.
///
/// - weight: Weight of the layer, which is a range from 1 to 10000 with a
///   default of 100. Layer weights are used during contention to prevent
///   starvation across layers. Weights are used in combination with
///   utilization to determine the infeasible adjusted weight with higher
///   weights having a larger adjustment in adjusted utilization.
///
/// - disallow_open_after_us: Duration to wait after machine reaches saturation
///   before confining tasks in Open layers.
///
/// - cpus_range_frac: Array of 2 floats between 0 and 1.0. Lower and upper
///   bound fractions of all CPUs to give to a layer. Mutually exclusive
///   with cpus_range.
///
/// - disallow_preempt_after_us: Duration to wait after machine reaches saturation
///   before confining tasks to preempt.
///
/// - xllc_mig_min_us: Skip cross-LLC migrations if they are likely to run on
///   their existing LLC sooner than this.
///
/// - idle_smt: *** DEPRECATED ****
///
/// - growth_algo: When a layer is allocated new CPUs different algorithms can
///   be used to determine which CPU should be allocated next. The default
///   algorithm is a "sticky" algorithm that attempts to spread layers evenly
///   across cores.
///
/// - perf: CPU performance target. 0 means no configuration. A value
///   between 1 and 1024 indicates the performance level CPUs running tasks
///   in this layer are configured to using scx_bpf_cpuperf_set().
///
/// - idle_resume_us: Sets the idle resume QoS value. CPU idle time governors are expected to
///   regard the minimum of the global (effective) CPU latency limit and the effective resume
///   latency constraint for the given CPU as the upper limit for the exit latency of the idle
///   states. See the latest kernel docs for more details:
///   https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/pm/cpuidle.html
///
/// - nodes: If set the layer will use the set of NUMA nodes for scheduling
///   decisions. If unset then all available NUMA nodes will be used. If the
///   llcs value is set the cpuset of NUMA nodes will be or'ed with the LLC
///   config.
///
/// - llcs: If set the layer will use the set of LLCs (last level caches)
///   for scheduling decisions. If unset then all LLCs will be used. If
///   the nodes value is set the cpuset of LLCs will be or'ed with the nodes
///   config.
///
///
/// Similar to matches, adding new policies and extending existing ones
/// should be relatively straightforward.
///
/// Configuration example and running scx_layered
/// =============================================
///
/// An scx_layered config is composed of layer configs. A layer config is
/// composed of a name, a set of matches, and a policy block. Running the
/// following will write an example configuration into example.json.
///
///   $ scx_layered -e example.json
///
