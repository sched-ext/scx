# Description

When a task's phase sequence includes Phase::Wake (from rt-app resume), the engine only executes one cycle even with repeat=true. The simple_wake.json workload (producer: run 5ms, wake consumer, run 5ms, sleep 10ms; consumer: suspend, run 10ms) produces only 10 events covering 10ms instead of ~50 cycles over 1 second. The Phase::Wake handler causes the waking task to sleep after the wake instead of continuing to its next phase (run1). This blocks real-vs-simulated comparison for any workload using suspend/resume.
