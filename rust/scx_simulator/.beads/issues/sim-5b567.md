# Description

The real kernel fires task_tick every ~1ms (HZ=1000) which triggers preemption checks. The simulator uses purely time-based preemption (slice expiry fires at exact time). This means: (1) preemption timing in the simulator is perfectly aligned to slice boundaries, unlike the real kernel where it aligns to tick boundaries, (2) there is no task_tick callback in the Scheduler trait, so schedulers can't implement tick-based logic. Discovered during real-vs-simulated trace comparison where the real trace showed ~1368 task_tick events over 5s on CPU 0.
