# Description

Epic tracking all missing COSMOS scheduler features in the simulator.

Currently the simulator exercises only the core deadline-scheduling algorithm
(vruntime, wakeup frequency, sleep credit, weight-based slicing) with a single
shared DSQ and simple idle-CPU selection via scx_bpf_select_cpu_dfl.

All topology-aware (SMT, NUMA), hardware-adaptive (cpufreq, PMU), and
optimization features (mm_affinity, deferred wakeups, idle scanning, primary
domain) are completely disabled via cosmos_setup() globals and macro overrides.

The goal is to incrementally add simulator infrastructure so that all relevant
kernel and processor features are modeled, exercising all COSMOS code paths
meaningfully. Each sub-issue covers one feature area.

See also: semantic inaccuracies to fix (scx_bpf_task_cpu returning current_cpu
instead of the task's last-scheduled CPU, dispatch receiving prev=NULL, etc).
